<h2 class="header">Terms and conditions</h2>

    <h3>Sales and Refund Policy</h3>
        
    <p> Thanks for shopping at iRent. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you 
        have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products.
    
        As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an iRent store. We’ll be as brief 
        as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an iRent store, 
        you agree to the terms set forth below along with iRent’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
    </p>
        
    <h3>Standard Return Policy</h3>
        
    <p> We fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the iRent Store. That’s because we go out of 
        our way to ensure that they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We understand, however, that sometimes a product 
        may not be what you expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning 
        a product.
 
        For any undamaged product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging along with the original receipt (or 
        gift receipt) within 14 days of the date you receive the product, and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the 
        original payment method. In addition, please note the following:

        Products can be returned only in the country in which they were originally purchased.
    </p>
        
    <h3>iRent Watch Returns</h3>
        
    <p> iRent Watch from the Edition collection may only be returned or exchanged if it’s in its original, undamaged and unmarked 
        condition after passing inspection at iRent’s offsite facility. Depending on your original form of tender, a check, wire transfer, 
        or refund to your debit/credit card will be issued within 10 business days provided the returned item is in its original condition.

        Making unauthorized modifications to the software on a gear watch violates the watch software license agreement. The common term 
        for modifying a gear watch is jail-breaking, with a particular emphasis on the second part of that term. That’s why we strongly, 
        almost emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. Really. Should you be unable to use your gear watch due to an unauthorized 
        software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty.
    </p>
        
    <h3> Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections</h3>
        
    <p> iRent reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the iRent Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors 
        that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Pricing page. 
        In the event you have been charged more than the posted price for a product in an iRent Store, please see a Manager for a refund 
        of the overcharge.
 
        Should iRent reduce its price on any iRent-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel 
        free to visit an iRent Store or contact the iRent Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or credit of the 
        difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact 
        iRent within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those 
        that occur during special sales events, such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday.

        Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product. Additionally, we may require that you have the 
        product with you or otherwise have proof of possession when requesting price protection.

        Prices shown are in EUR. If you are paying for your order with an international Visa, MasterCard, or American Express credit 
        card, please note that the purchase price may fluctuate with exchange rates. In addition, your bank or credit card issuer may 
        also charge you foreign conversion charges and fees, which may also increase the overall cost of your purchase. Please contact 
        your bank or credit card issuer regarding these fees.
    </p>
        
    <h3>Order Acceptance/Confirmation </h3>
        
    <p> iRent may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity. Apple may also require additional 
        qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. Once we receive your Online or Call Center order, we’ll 
        provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify iRent’s 
        acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received 
        your order. The iRent Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any 
        reason. If Apple cancels an order after you have already been billed, iRent will refund the billed amount.
    </p>
        
    <h3>Shipping & Delivery</h3>
        
    <p> Please review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the 
        iRent Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond iRent’s control once it leaves our 
        facilities, iRent cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.
    </p>
        
    <h3>Consumers Only</h3>
        
    <p> The iRent Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order 
        if we suspect you are purchasing products for resale.

        Europe Shipping Only

        Products purchased online from iRent will only be shipped to addresses within Europe and are subject to Europe and foreign 
        export control laws and regulations. Products must be purchased, sold, exported, re-exported, transferred, and used in compliance 
        with these export laws and regulations. To purchase iRent products online from outside of Europe, please click here for 
        international store information.
    </p>
        
    <h3>Product Availability and Limitations</h3>
        
    <p> Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, iRent may have to limit the number of products 
        available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building them as fast as we can. iRent reserves the right to change quantities 
        available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when iRent confirms 
        your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, 
        iRent will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.
    </p>
